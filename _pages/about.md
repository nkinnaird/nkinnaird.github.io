### Welcome!

My name is Nicholas Kinnaird, or Nick for short. I am a physics PhD turned data scientist. I'm currently attending the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) data science boot camp, which is a 12-week immersive course slated to end March 26th, 2021. Check out my [portfolio](https://nkinnaird.github.io/portfolio/) for projects I've done, as well as my [blog](https://nkinnaird.github.io/blog-posts/). After the boot camp ends, I'll be applying to data scientist positions in the Chicago area, where I currently live with my girlfriend and crazy cat.


Before Metis, I worked as a graduate student and then postdoctoral researcher at Boston University. I did my PhD research on the [Fermilab Muon <i>g − 2</i> physics experiment](https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/), which is a high-profile, on-going, experiment with the goal of measuring the muon magnetic anomaly to 140 parts per billion. Along the way, I've gained a wealth of experience in project design, working with interdisciplinary teams all focused on one over-arching goal, data processing and analysis on PB-size datasets, presenting, and technical writing. (And I've had a ton of fun along the way.) My [dissertation](https://github.com/nkinnaird/Dissertation) includes the results of much of my work.


While I've had a ton of fun and worked with some great people in the physics community and on the Fermilab Muon <i>g − 2</i> experiment, data science has really grabbed my enthusiasm. I'm excited to explore all sorts of cool new techniques, while at the same time working on practical, real-world applications.


Please feel free to reach out to me for any reason, whether that's to chat about my PhD work, my experiences in making the transition from academia to industry, or the data science projects I've worked on while at Metis.


*Note, this website is still a bit of a work in progress as I slowly but surely update it with my various blog and project posts.*
