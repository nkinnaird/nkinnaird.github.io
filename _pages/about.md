### Welcome!

My name is Nicholas Kinnaird, or Nick for short. I am a physics PhD turned data scientist. I'm currently attending the [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) data science boot camp, which is a 12-week immersive course slated to end March 26th, 2021. Check out my [portfolio](https://nkinnaird.github.io/portfolio/) for projects I've done, as well as my [blog](https://nkinnaird.github.io/blog-posts/). After the boot camp ends, I'll be applying to data scientist positions in the Chicago area, where I currently live with my girlfriend and crazy cat.


Before Metis, I worked as a graduate student and then postdoctoral researcher at Boston University. I did my PhD research on the [Fermilab Muon <i>g âˆ’ 2</i> physics experiment](https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/), which is a high-profile, on-going, experiment with the goal of measuring the muon magnetic anomaly to extremely high precision. Along the way, I've gained a wealth of experience in project design, working with interdisciplinary teams,, data processing and analysis on PB-size datasets, presenting, and technical writing. (I've also had a ton of fun and made some amazing friends along the way.) My [dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svdQTMf3DBS_IxlBcKcXCyd4XHIo__C7/view?usp=sharing) includes the results of much of my work.


After a year of working as a postdoc to tie off loose ends in my graduate work, I decided that the academia lifestyle wasn't the best fit for me, and to make the transition to data science. Beyond being a great fit for the skill-set I developed as a physics researcher, the data science industry has really grabbed my enthusiasm and excitement. Analyzing interesting data in real-world applications with advanced techniques is exactly the sort of environment that I want to be in. Attending Metis is the first step in that transition, and I'm excited for the next one.


Please feel free to reach out to me for any reason, whether that's to chat about my PhD work, my experiences in making the transition from academia to industry, or the data science projects I've worked on while at Metis.


*Note: This website is still a bit of a work in progress as I slowly, but surely, update it with my various blog and project posts.*
