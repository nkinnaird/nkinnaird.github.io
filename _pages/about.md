This website is a work in progress. The template comes from [here](https://academicpages.github.io/).


Need to take my current about my section from my github page, update it, and place it here. (Then copy and adjust it on my github page.)





<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. 


For more info
------
More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
