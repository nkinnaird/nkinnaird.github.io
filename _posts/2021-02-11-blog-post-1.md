As part of the Metis data science boot camp requirements, we were required to investigate a topic and then present on it. With the physics background detailed on the main page, I was interested in learning a little bit more about machine learning applications in particle physics. While I never did any machine learning work as part of my graduate degree, and the experiment I was on didn't do any machine learning, it's always been interesting to me so I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity.

Please note that I am not an expert in this subject. Most of the material I will go through here has come from a lot of online searches, with one fantastic source being the [Living Review of Machine Learning for Particle Physics](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/) I found on GitHub, which contains a wealth of links to various papers. If you spot any misrepresentations in the material below, please do not hesitate to reach out to me so that I can correct them!

### What is particle physics and why use machine learning ?
<!-- ====== -->

Particle physics is the study of the basic blocks of matter. While there are smaller experiments located around the world, the majority of research is driven by large accelerators and particle colliders. These accelerators crash particles into each other or into some material in order to produce new interesting particles and interactions. By measuring what happens after the collisions with various 'experiments', physicists can derive the underlying laws which govern our universe. Collisions happen many times a second as these accelerators run, and the experiments gather an astronomical amount of data every second. And as any one learning about the data science and machine learning world knows, a wealth of data is exactly where machine learning becomes really useful.

In general my feeling for the physics community is that there is somewhat of a split in attitudes as to the acceptance of machine learning methods. Some people are against it in favor of the more traditional 'physics-based' modeling, and argue against the black-box nature of many machine learning models. Others are for it and have put it to good use, and there's no denying it's effectiveness. While understanding the physical and mathematical motivations behind any used models will always be necessary, as more and more research is done into the subject and the community-wide understanding grows around machine learning methods, they will make their way into more and more applications.


From my research most of the research I've been able to find on this subject has been done in the last few years, with the earliest examples going back ten years or so. Most of the machine learning methods appear to be supervised models, which makes sense to me as physics is more of a deductive science than an inductive one. As for the techniques themselves, most of the earlier models were along the lines of decision tree ensembles, while more of the recent models are some type of neural network or other. 



### Applications

From here on out I'll go through some various use cases; keep in mind that this is by no means exhaustive. For a lot of my examples I've taken images and plots from various public papers and presentations and include the respective citations.



#### Triggering and filtering

If the experiments mentioned up above gathered all data that was produced, the data rate would be of order PBs data per second. In order to reduce this to a more manageable level (GBs/s), the data is filtered with various trigger systems which decide whether or not to keep the data event by event. Most trigger systems currently use traditional, hard-cut, techniques on some parameter like the transverse-momentum, but some use machine learning methods, and more are planning on doing so. The power and flexibility of these new methods open up new opportunities for improved data taking and selection. And as any good scientist knows, getting the useful data is the hardest part. By improving the pipeline at the very beginning, every stage later on is improved.

 The LHCb experiment in particular uses a neural network to remove "fake" and uninteresting events
