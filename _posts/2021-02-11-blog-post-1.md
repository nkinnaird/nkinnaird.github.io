As part of the Metis data science boot camp requirements, we were required to investigate a topic and then present on it. With the physics background detailed on the main page, I was interested in learning a little bit more about machine learning applications in particle physics. While I never did any machine learning work as part of my graduate degree, and the experiment I was on didn't do any machine learning, it's always been interesting to me so I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity.

Please note that I am not an expert in this subject. Most of the material I will go through here has come from a lot of online searches, with one fantastic source being the [Living Review of Machine Learning for Particle Physics](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/) I found on GitHub, which contains a wealth of links to various papers. If you spot any misrepresentations in the material below, please do not hesitate to reach out to me so that I can correct them!

What is particle physics and why use machine learning ?
======

Particle physics is the study of the basic blocks of matter. While there are smaller experiments located around the world, the majority of research is driven by large accelerators and particle colliders. These accelerators crash particles into each other or into some material in order to produce new interesting particles and interactions. By measuring what happens after the collisions with various 'experiments', physicists can derive the underlying laws which govern our universe. Collisions happen many times a second as these accelerators run, and the experiments gather an astonomical amount of data every second. And as any one learning about the data science and machine learning world knows, a wealth of data is exactly where machine learning becomes really useful.
