*Note: This blog is a work in progress.*

For my final [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) data science boot camp project, I decided to create a mangrove forest classifier from a neural network trained on satellite imagery. 


## Mangrove Forests


## The Data


## Models


## Conclusions and Future Work






links I want to include in this blog somewhere:

[article1](https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-network-for-satellite-data-classification-using-tensorflow-in-python-a13bcf38f3e1) and [article2](https://towardsdatascience.com/is-cnn-equally-shiny-on-mid-resolution-satellite-data-9e24e68f0c08) on getting startied with neural networks on satellite imagery by P. Tripathy


[tutorial website](https://geohackweek.github.io/GoogleEarthEngine/) for learing how to use GEE, specifically the "Accessing Satellite Imagery" section was very useful


[paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x) by C. Giri et al. in 2011 where the mapped mangrove forests came from before being put into GEE


some papers of work people are doing:

papers or articles describing mangrove forest monitoring/mapping/etc. by groups/people who really know what they are doing:


[general 2018 medium article](https://medium.com/google-earth/mangrove-monitoring-in-google-earth-engine-4d6f6be8d7fc) describing and linking various approaches by different groups around the world/different locations


[medium 2020 article](https://medium.com/uk-hydrographic-office/scaling-machine-learning-models-across-the-globe-the-quest-for-geo-generalisability-in-mangrove-f14282738378) by the UKHO (Hydrographic Office) doing machine learning across the globe with generalized models


[2019 article](https://www.intechopen.com/books/geographic-information-systems-and-science/gis-and-remote-sensing-for-mangroves-mapping-and-monitoring) by blank mapping mangroves in Malaysia

[GEEMMM](https://github.com/Blue-Ventures-Conservation/GEEMMM) github project (Google Earth Engine Mangrove Mapping Methodology) for mapping mangroves funded by Blue Ventures Conservation with funding from UK Governmentâ€™s International Climate Fund


these are only some, there are others...
