*Note: This blog is a work in progress.*

For my final [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/) data science boot camp project, I knew I wanted to get some experience using neural networks on image data. After going back and forth on a ton of ideas (who doesn't when they are trying to come up with an interesting, but do-able, project), I ultimately landed on classifying mangrove forests using satellite imagery.

<!-- I decided to create a mangrove forest classifier from a neural network trained on satellite imagery.  -->


## Mangrove Forests

Mangroves are tropical trees which live and thrive along salty, warm coastal waters. As of now, there is around 135,000 square kilometers of mangrove forested areas around the world. These mangrove forests provide an incredible ability to store carbon, indeed 4-10 times more than land forests, protect shorelines against storms, filter pollutants from the ocean waters, and provide natural habitats for many species. As climate change worsens, the protection and conservation of mangroves is very important. Per the [Global Mangrove Alliance](http://www.mangrovealliance.org/mangrove-knowledge/), these mangrove forests are being degraded at about 1% per year. Finding ways to better track them will allow for better conservation efforts worldwide. 


## Satellite Monitoring

Using satellite imagery to map and monitor mangroves worldwide is a powerful tool that can be used. Indeed various groups are doing this with a lot of advanced efforts in recent years.

## My Project - My Data
**Need to split this up into 2 sections somehow I think.**

For my project, given the time constraints (about 3 weeks) and my introduction to the topic and tools, I decided to start from the ground up and keep things simple. I found on Google Earth Enginea nicely labeled dataset of mangrove forests mapped around the world by [C. Giri et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00584.x) in 2011 for the year 2000. 

-somewhere here or later need to introduce project ideas, ie. 2020 vs 2000


Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful tool which allows free access to a wealth of satellite imagery, along with a straightforward API for accessing that imagery and outputting information of interest. I started my project by learning how to use the API along with a little bit of JavaScript along the way. To put it simply, you load collections of satellite images, filter those images by time or location, and can then composite those images and lastly export them to somewhere like Google Drive. (You can find [here](https://geohackweek.github.io/GoogleEarthEngine/) a very nice website which provides tutorials on how to get started. I found the section "Accessing Satellite Imagery" particularly useful.)


From my research I knew that the labeled mangrove map was built on Landsat 5 satellite data. Because I wanted to compare 2020 satellite imagery results to those mapped in 2000, I knew I needed current satellite imagery. Landsat 5 was decommissioned in 2013, so I was left with either choosing Landsat 7 or Landsat 8 data. I chose Landsat 7 data, because it was active in the year 2000 and was still active in 2020, allowing me to train a model using the same satellite system data as the data I will then later predict on. (I thought about using Landsat 8, and indeed that might prove better for the 2020 data as I never tested it, however the data specifications are different and I was therefore worried that my predictive model would not properly transfer.) 


The Landsat 7 data has a resolution of 30 meters per pixel, and contains information in 7 different bands. These are the standard RGB bands, along with a near infrared bed, 2 shortwave infrared bands, and a thermal band. (There is also an eighth band with 15 meter resolution, that being the panchromatic band. I chose to drop this band and simply train on the rest of the band information.) My project then became the goal of pixel-wise classification of this satellite imagery using this band information.



For the satellite imagery that I generated, each individual satellite image by itself would not work for classification. Certain areas are only captured once every 16 days (check this), and in the image there is liable to be clouds which obscure the regions of interest. GEE has some nice functionality to composite a single image from many other images based on various features. I therefore masked out all the pixels which contained clouds or cloud shadows to get pure land and water images. One last issue remained, that of pixel selection versus time. Mangrove forests may not be as abundant in the winter months as the summer months for instance, and I want my images to properly represent the totality of mangrove forests. Therefore I selected each pixel in the composite image as that pixel from the image collection which had the maximum "normalized difference vegetation index" or NDVI. The NDVI is essentially the difference between the near infrared band and the red band, and it is the standard measure for whether a pixel contains living green vegetation. By compositing my image with pixels selected by their maximum NDVI values, I can account for different seasons and the like throughout the year.


- put a picture here of the NDVI band
- maybe also a gif flashing between the NDVI band and the mangrove band to show the comparison



Lastly, I decided to focus on one area of interest, that being the Florida coastline. There are over 60 mangrove species around the world with different physical characteristics. In my exploratory data analysis phase of the project I did test out other locations such as places in Brazil, Cuba, and Cameroon. In some instances the trained model performed well in other locations, while in some instances it did not. Hence I decided to restrict my project to a single area where the satellite image colors were consistent.
