For my second Metis project, I predicted US county Covid-19 deaths (scaled by population) using US census data in order to identify those counties which are more at risk than others. By identifying these counties, resources can be deployed more efficiently. The figures below show the number of Covid-19 deaths scaled per 100k persons for counties in the US, and then the predicted deaths vs actual deaths from my model. This project used regression and web-scraping. Please see the [project GitHub page](https://github.com/nkinnaird/CountyCovidIndexing) for more extensive details.
