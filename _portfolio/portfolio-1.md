One primary component of the Fermilab Muon Muon <i>g − 2</i> experiment is the extraction of a specific so-called 'precession' frequency from large amounts (PBs) of data to high precision. As one of the lead analyzers for the first data-taking period of the experiment, I developed code which fit the data with physical and mathematical models in a specific way which reduced systematic biases. As part of the project I conducted many statistical and systematic evaluations on the data and the results of the fits. I also conducted many smaller toy Monte Carlo simulations in order to help develop my understanding of the real, sometimes messy, data in a clean environment.

Below is an image containing the final (blinded) fits to the four datasets gathered in the first data-taking period of the experiment, where the precisions on the extracted frequncies are at the parts-per-million (ppm) level or smaller. Also included is a plot of the fit residuals and associated FFT for one of the datasets.
